Testing By Bradley Pellegrini on Project 4:

Test 1:
DB File: 
Bookings_db.dat
Search Mode:
Contains Text
Searching For:
Bradle
Number of Results Expected:
3
Number of Results Received:
2

Reason For Difference:
This is a known issue with the binary search.  I believe it is an issue
that occurs when the lists size becomes under a certain size during a 
search of a name that occurs on the edge.  To test a larger db would be
necessary.


Test 2:
DB File: 
Bookings_db.dat
Search Mode:
Full Name
Searching For:
Christopher Dombroski
Number of Results Expected:
3
Number of Results Received:
2
Reason For Difference:
Expected to be an issue with the name being dead centre of the binary
 search but it is unsure what the cause is.  This would require more
 testing and a larger DB file which CD was unable to provide.

Bookings_db.dat
Search Mode:
Contains Text
Searching For:
Christopher Dombroski
